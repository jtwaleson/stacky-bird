Stacky Bird
====

Stacky Bird is a game where you learn to program using low level commands and a stack. I'm writing it for my son. It is currently under construction and not playable yet.

This game was inspired by 2048, Flappy Bird, SpaceChem and my trusty old HP 49G+ calculator on which I used to program UserRPL.

See it in action!

Compilation
----

You need to install Typescript and then compile the program with

tsc src/main.ts --out bin/script.js

Optionally use the Grunt task,

    npm install
    grunt typescript


This is what kids said about Stacky Bird
----

My grades were pretty bad and I didn't really understand Maths. With Stacky Bird, I invented my own Maths with blackjack and hookers!
(Heinrich, Germany, 10)

I used to be lonely and sad, but since I discovered Stacky Bird, I just stopped caring.
(Tim, UK, 11)

My father didn't respect me because he's a programmer and I used to enjoy sports. Everything is better now that we've discovered Stacky Bird!
(Suzanne, The Netherlands, 8)

My girlfriend left me, I lost my job and my parents would't pick me up from school anymore. Since I've started using Stacky Bird I got a new girlfriend, I had a dozen job offers at top technology firms and I can pay a taxi to bring me home.
