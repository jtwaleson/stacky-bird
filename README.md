Stacky Bird
====

Stacky Bird is a game where you learn to program using low level commands and a stack. I'm writing it for my son. It is currently under construction and not playable yet.

This game was inspired by 2048, Flappy Bird, SpaceChem and my trusty old HP 49G+ calculator on which I used to program UserRPL.

See it in action!

You need to install Typescript and then compile the program with

Optionally use the Grunt task,

    npm install
    grunt typescript


To do
----

 * add step button
 * add right arrow on home block
 * create first levels, with message popups etcetera
 * save level in localStorage
 * have example factories that just run
