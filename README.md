Stacky Bird
====

Stacky Bird is a game where you learn to program using low level commands and a stack. I'm writing it for my son. It is currently under construction and not playable yet.

This game was inspired by 2048, Flappy Bird, SpaceChem and my trusty old HP 49G+ calculator on which I used to program UserRPL.

See it in action!

Compilation
----

You need to install Typescript and then compile the program with

tsc src/main.ts --out bin/script.js
