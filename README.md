Stacky Bird
====

Stacky Bird is a game where you learn to program using low level commands and a stack without realizing that you're actually learning it.

This game was inspired by:
- [2048](https://play2048.co/)
- [Flappy Bird](https://flappybird.io/)
- [SpaceChem](http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/)
- [Universal Paperclips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html)
- my trusty old [HP 49G+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_49/50_series) calculator on which I used to program UserRPL

I started this game in 2014 when my son was just born. Now that he's 5 he could actually start playing it so I revived the project.

See it in action!

This is what kids said about Stacky Bird

My grades were pretty bad and I didn't really understand Maths. With Stacky Bird, I invented my own Maths with blackjack and hookers!
(Heinrich, Germany, 10)

I used to be lonely and sad, but since I discovered Stacky Bird, I just stopped caring.
(Tim, UK, 11)

My father didn't respect me because he's a programmer and I used to enjoy sports. Everything is better now that we've discovered Stacky Bird!
(Suzanne, The Netherlands, 8)

My girlfriend left me, I lost my job and my parents would't pick me up from school anymore. Since I've started using Stacky Bird I got a new girlfriend, I had a dozen job offers at top technology firms and I can pay a taxi to bring me home.
