Stacky Bird Levels
====

The idea behind stacky bird levels is that each "chapter" uses a certain kind of tools to create a solution. Each chapter goes very deep. After a couple of levels in chapter 0, chapter 1 will be unlocked. The player can continue in chapter 1 or chapter 0 at will.

0xxx - Movement
====
- left/right/up/down
- jumps (2x, 4x, 6x)
- waiting for user input (has to press space to continue)
- picking up registers and bringing them home
- portals
- avoiding monsters
- mazes ( can be much larger than 7x7 )
- ??? this might get boring
- can unlock larger boards (user can expand a board?)

1xxx - Transistor Logic
====
- flip-flops / latches
- and/or/xor switches

2xxx - Registers
====
- read write to registers
- after some time, input output (users can drop the top of their stack on an input and it pops up at the output)

3xxx - The Stack
====
- dup, rot, pick, put
- arithmetic
- filter
- sum
- can unlock larger stacks
- ...

4xxx - Advanced Stacks
====
- sorting stacks
- dropping entire stacks in a register (turing machine)

5xxx - Multi-Bird Programming
====
- users can spawn new birds to solve problems in a more efficient way
- synchronization primitives (mutex)

6xxx - Functions
====
- Jump between multiple boards, each named board can implement a function

7xxx - Printing & Emailing
====
- Fetch data from an inbox
- Print the data to an LCD display
- You get a question "12 + 8" and you have to print it or reply with an email

8xxx - Algorithms
====
- At some point it may be possible to implement basic Google CodeJam algorithms, that would be amazing


9xxx - Arrays ?
====
- Add an array for addressable storage
